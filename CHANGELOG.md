# Changelog

All notable changes to slskr are documented here. Release pages are generated
from the tagged source by the release workflow, with structured fragments from
`release-notes/` assembled into the user-facing release section.

Use release sections in this form:

```markdown
## [<version>] — YYYY-MM-DD
```

Keep the file append-only at the release-section level. Add shipped user-facing
bullets to `## [Unreleased]`, then move them into the dated version section when
the release is prepared. Do not rewrite audited release history.

---

## [Unreleased]

- Release validation now captures structured release details and publishes the
  same curated summary in GitHub releases and Discord announcements.
